
Q5.
The radius of a circle is 30 meters.
• Calculate the area of a circle and assign the value to a variable name of _area_of_circle_
• Calculate the circumference of a circle and assign the value to a variable name of 
_circum_of_circle_
• Take radius as user input and calculate the area.

r = 30


_Area_Of_Circle = 3.14 * r * r
print(f"The area of circle with radius 30 is {round(_Area_Of_Circle,2)}")
_Circum_Of_Circle_ = 2 * 3.14 * r
print(f"The circumference of circle with radius 30 is {round(_Circum_Of_Circle_,2)}")
r = float(input("Enter Radius of Choice:"))
print(f"The area of circle with radius {r} is {round(3.14 * r * r,2)}")
