Q3.
#Create a tuple containing names of your sisters and your brothers (imaginary siblings are 
fine)
     my_tuplebrother =()
     my_tuplebrother= ("minaz", "rajesh", "Srikanth")
     print(my_tuplebrother)
     my_tuplesister =()
     my_tuplesister=(" jineesha", "revathi", "veena")
     print(my_tuplesister)
Join brothers and sisters tuples and assign it to siblings
     my_tuplesiblings = ()
     my_tuplesiblings =  my_tuplebrother + my_tuplesister
     print(my_tuplesiblings)
How many siblings do you have?
     print(len(my_tuplesiblings))
Modify the siblings tuple and add the name of your father and mother and assign it to 
family_members
     my_familymember = ()
     my_familymember = my_tuplesiblings + ("kavitha", "gopal")
     print(my_familymember)
