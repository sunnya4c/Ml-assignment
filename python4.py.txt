• Find the length of the set it_companies
• Add 'Twitter' to it_companies
• Insert multiple IT companies at once to the set it_companies
• Remove one of the companies from the set it_companies
• What is the difference between remove and discard
• Join A and B
• Find A intersection B
• Is A subset of B
• Are A and B disjoint sets
• Join A with B and B with A
• What is the symmetric difference between A and B
• Delete the sets completely
• Convert the ages to a set and compare the length of the list and the set.
