Q9.
Write a program, which reads weights (lbs.) of N students into a list and convert these weights to 
kilograms in a separate list using Loop. N: No of students (Read input from user)
Ex: L1: [150, 155, 145, 148]
Output: [68.03, 70.3, 65.77, 67.13]#list of students weights

lbs =  [150, 155, 145, 148, 120, 130, 100]
kgs = []

for Z in LBS:
    kgs.append(round(Z * 0.45359237,2))

print(f"weight in kgs: {kgs}")
