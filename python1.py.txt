Q1. 
#Sort the list and find the min and max age
      ages=[19, 22, 19, 24, 20, 25, 26, 24, 25, 24]
      ages.sort()
      print(ages)
      b=min(ages)
      c=max(ages)
      print(b)
      print(c)
#Add the min age and the max age again to the list
      ages.append(max(ages))
      ages.append(min(ages))
      print(ages)
#Find the median age (one middle item or two middle items divided by two)
median =int(len(ages/2)
print(median)

#Find the average age (sum of all items divided by their number)
      average = sum(ages) / len(ages)
      print(average)      
#Find the range of the ages (max minus min)
     mami= max(ages)-min(ages)
     print(mami)
